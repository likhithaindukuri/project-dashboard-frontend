# AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools as permitted in the assignment guidelines.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT

## How AI Was Used
- Planning the overall project structure and step-by-step implementation approach
- Clarifying requirements and edge cases from the assignment description
- Drafting initial versions of some React components and filtering logic
- Helping structure README documentation

## What Was Modified or Rejected
- Component code suggested by AI was simplified to improve readability
- Some proposed abstractions were intentionally not implemented to avoid over-engineering
- Styling suggestions were minimized to keep the focus on logic and structure

## Critical Review of AI Output
- Some AI-generated solutions suggested additional layers of abstraction that were unnecessary for this scope
- Performance optimizations were avoided because the dataset is small and static
- All AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and adapted before being committed

## Final Responsibility
All code decisions, structure, and trade-offs were reviewed and finalized by me.  
I am comfortable explaining and defending every part of this implementation.
